this is the <strong>first time</strong> <u>my gosh</u> starting the coding practice.
 i am really thrilled to create the web ive only seen on the web browsers.



They all say I'm full of lust
I’m addicted to girls' touch<br>
There's no woman I don’t love
Mutual feelings mean so much
Sometimes I'm out of control

<p style="margin-top:60px;">I'm afraid to let someone grow into my own
Every good thing you've seen from me was fake
I'm too unfaithful, I've been playing games
I have way too many friends
Playin' in my bed
You're reading my
Eyes and lips
What’s in my head
Everything makes sense now
But you know</p>



What we
Have here
Is special
And real
